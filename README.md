Final Report:
Intro
The Medicine Record Management System is a console-based application developed in C programming language. This system is designed to maintain the records of medicines in a medical store. The system provides functionalities like adding new medicines, deleting medicines, updating medicines, searching for a particular medicine, and displaying the list of all medicines stored in the system.

Features:
The Medicine Record Management System has the following features:

Add Medicine: This feature allows the user to add new medicines to the system. The user needs to provide the details like medicine name, type, rate, manufacture date, expiry date, and quantity. The system stores this information in a file.

Delete Medicine: This feature allows the user to delete a particular medicine from the system. The user needs to provide the name of the medicine to be deleted. The system then searches for the medicine in the file and deletes it if found.

Update Medicine: This feature allows the user to update the details of a particular medicine. The user needs to provide the name of the medicine to be updated, and then the system displays the current details of the medicine. The user can then update any field of the medicine and save the changes.

Search Medicine: This feature allows the user to search for a particular medicine. The user needs to provide the name of the medicine to be searched. The system then searches for the medicine in the file and displays its details if found.

Display Medicine: This feature allows the user to view the list of all medicines stored in the system. The system displays the details like medicine name, type, rate, manufacture date, expiry date, and quantity for each medicine.

About Us: This feature provides information about the system and its developers.

Login: This feature allows only the authorized users to access the system. The user needs to enter the correct username and password to log in.

Implementation:
The Medicine Record Management System is implemented using C programming language. The system uses a file to store the details of all medicines. The system menu is displayed using the printf statement. The user input is taken using the scanf statement. The switch-case statement is used to implement the different functionalities of the system.

The login feature is implemented using the do-while loop. The system prompts the user to enter the username and password. If the user enters the correct username and password, the system displays the menu. If the user enters the wrong username and password, the system prompts the user to try again.

Conclusion:
The Medicine Record Management System is an efficient and user-friendly system for maintaining the records of medicines in a medical store. The system provides functionalities like adding new medicines, deleting medicines, updating medicines, searching for a particular medicine, and displaying the list of all medicines stored in the system. The system is implemented using C programming language and uses a file to store the details of all medicines. The login feature provides security and restricts unauthorized access to the system.
